velodyne_points : Contains the Lidar point returns in a sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message type. The Lidar is a Velodyne Puck VLP16 and the message are the individual packets sent by the sensor. The position of the LiDAR in car_frame is x= 1.6 m, y= 0.0 m.

optical_speed_sensor: Contains ground speed data in a geometry_msgs/TwistStamped message type. This sensor is a Kistler Correvit SFII. The position of this sensor in the car frame is x= -0.41m y= 0.27 m.

wheel_rpm : contains the wheel speed data in a geometry_msgs/QuaternionStamped message type. x -> front left wheel, y -> front right wheel. z -> rear left wheel. w -> rear right wheel. The data is expressed in rpm's. The distance to thefront axel is 0.81m, to the rear axel 0.72m, and the track width is 1.2m.

imu : Contains the accelerometer and gyroscopes information in a sensor_msgs/Imu message type. This sensor is an SBG ellipse-N. The position of this sensor in the car frame is x = 0.0 m, y = 0.0 m.

gps : Contains the GPS information in sensor_msgs/NavSatFix message type. The data is expressed in degrees for Lattitue and Longitude. The sensor is the same SBG ellipse-N used as IMU.
