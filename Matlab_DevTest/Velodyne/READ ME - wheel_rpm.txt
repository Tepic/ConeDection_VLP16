wheel_rpm : contains the wheel speed data in a geometry_msgs/QuaternionStamped message type. x -> front left wheel, y -> front right wheel. z -> rear left wheel. w -> rear right wheel. The data is expressed in rpm's. The distance to thefront axel is 0.81m, to the rear axel 0.72m, and the track width is 1.2m.

# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data 
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called ''secs'')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called ''nsecs'')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
# 0: no frame
# 1: global frame
